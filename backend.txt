# RetroFlow Frontend Development Log

## Overview
RetroFlow is a retrospective application built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. It supports real-time collaboration through Socket.IO for team retrospective sessions.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Connected Card Grouping System
**Purpose**: Allow users to visually connect related cards in the grouping phase, which then appear as single merged items in voting.

**Implementation**:
- **Frontend Logic**: `src/components/phases/VotingPhase.tsx`
  - `buildConnectedGroups()` function using depth-first search (DFS) algorithm
  - Creates adjacency map from connections data
  - Finds connected components and merges them into single voting items
  - Groups connected cards with bullet-separated content (e.g., "Card A ‚Ä¢ Card B ‚Ä¢ Card C")
  - Uses `connected-uuid1--uuid2--uuid3` format (double-dash separator to avoid UUID collision)

- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Connected groups show "üîó Connected" badge
  - Individual cards displayed as normal single-item groups

### 2. Connection Line System
**Purpose**: Visual connection lines between cards in grouping phase.

**Implementation**: `src/components/phases/GroupingPhase.tsx`
- SVG-based connection system with z-index layering
- Connection points moved from card centers to right edges
- Parabolic curves for same-column connections, straight lines for different columns
- Clickable connection lines for removal with hover effects
- Data stored as Connection entities with fromResponseId/toResponseId

### 3. Voting Progress Tracking
**Purpose**: Host can see real-time voting progress for all participants.

**Implementation**: `src/components/phases/VotingPhase.tsx`
- Host-only sidebar showing remaining votes per participant
- Real-time updates via socket events
- Visual progress indicators with colored dots
- Excludes host from progress tracking

### 4. Individual Vote Display
**Purpose**: Show only current user's votes instead of accumulated total during voting.

**Implementation**: 
- Modified voting cards to display `userVotes` instead of `voteCount`
- Total vote calculation moved to results phase
- Each participant sees only their own vote distribution

### 5. Results Without Votes Fix
**Purpose**: Display all cards/groups in results even when no votes are cast.

**Implementation**: `src/components/phases/ResultsPhase.tsx`
- Removed `voteCount > 0` filtering that was hiding unvoted groups
- Added fallback `buildConnectedGroupsForResults()` function
- Creates groups from raw responses when no voting occurred
- Handles connected card grouping in results phase
- Sorts by vote count first, then by response count for 0-vote items

### 6. Presentation Mode
**Purpose**: Host-controlled presentation of results with participant synchronization.

**Implementation**: 
- Full-screen presentation view with navigation controls
- Real-time synchronization via socket events
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, space, escape)
- Progress dots for navigation
- Works with both voted and unvoted results

### 7. Creative UI Enhancements

#### Main Page Heading Styling
**Implementation**: `src/app/page.tsx` + `src/app/globals.css`
- **"REDAPL"**: Purple-pink-red gradient, bold weight, slight left rotation
- **"STORAGE"**: Orange-yellow gradient, bold weight, 2px elevated positioning
- **"Retro"**: Green-blue-purple gradient, bold weight, slight right rotation
- **"üöÄ"**: Floating animation with 3-second loop
- Animated gradients with shifting background positions
- Hover effects with scale and translate transforms

#### Apple Background Decorations
**Implementation**: `src/app/globals.css` + applied to main containers
- Random apple emoji (üçé) positioning with CSS pseudo-elements
- 6 apples total: 2 via CSS pseudo-elements, 4 via div elements
- Low opacity (0.08-0.1) for subtle visual effect
- Random rotations for natural appearance
- Responsive: 2 apples on mobile, 6 on desktop

#### Color Palette Updates
- Replaced all pink gradient colors with teal, then teal with warm green
- Main background: `from-cyan-200 via-purple-200 to-green-200`
- Consistent color scheme across all pages and components

### 8. Technical Improvements

#### Timer Security
**Verification**: Timer is properly backend-driven and cannot be manipulated from browser
- Server calculates and stores `timerEndTime` in database
- Client only displays countdown, has no authority over timer logic
- All phase transitions controlled by server-side socket handlers

#### Socket Connection Stability
**Current State**: Using stable WebSocket configuration
- Transports: `['websocket', 'polling']`
- Reconnection enabled with 5 attempts
- 20-second timeout with proper error handling

#### Build System
- Next.js 15.4.6 with Turbopack
- Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- TypeScript with strict configuration
- ESLint with Next.js rules

## Component Architecture

### Phase Components
- `InputPhase.tsx`: Card input with timer and real-time updates
- `GroupingPhase.tsx`: Card positioning and connection line drawing
- `VotingPhase.tsx`: Connected group voting with progress tracking
- `ResultsPhase.tsx`: Results display and presentation mode

### Shared Components
- `Timer.tsx`: Backend-driven timer with color-coded display
- `CreateSession.tsx` / `JoinSession.tsx`: Session management
- Socket service layer with proper error handling

## Database Integration
- Session data includes `connections`, `responses`, `groups`, `votes`
- Connected groups created dynamically during voting
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO events

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Connected card grouping fully functional
- ‚úÖ Results display works with and without votes
- ‚úÖ Presentation mode synchronized across participants
- ‚úÖ Creative UI elements enhance user experience
- ‚úÖ Real-time voting progress tracking for hosts
- ‚úÖ Stable socket connections and error handling
